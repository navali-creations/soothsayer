- **"What's New" shows automatically after an update:** When you launch the app after installing an update, the "What's New" dialog will automatically pop up after a few seconds so you never miss what changed. It only appears once per update.

- **Styled commit and contributor links in "What's New":** Commit references and contributor mentions in release notes now appear as neat, styled badges instead of plain links, making them easier to spot at a glance.
