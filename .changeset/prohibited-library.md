- **Prohibited Library rarity source:** You can now use the Prohibited Library (community-sourced stacked deck weight data) as a rarity source. Select it from the rarity source dropdown in Settings — it's no longer grayed out.

- **Weight-based card rarities:** Card rarities are derived from empirical drop-weight data collected by the Path of Exile Science & Data community, offering an alternative to price-based (poe.ninja) classification.

- **Rarity Model integration:** A new "Prohibited Library" column appears on the Rarity Model comparison page, letting you compare weight-based rarities against poe.ninja prices and your loot filters side-by-side. Clickable rarity badges in the column header let you sort by specific tiers.

- **Boss-exclusive card indicators:** Cards that are boss-exclusive drops (and therefore cannot drop from Stacked Decks) are now marked with a skull-crown icon in the Rarity Model table, so you can identify them at a glance.

- **Prohibited Library status block:** When the Prohibited Library is selected as your rarity source, a new status panel in Settings shows the loaded league, card count, app version, and last-loaded timestamp. A reload button lets you re-parse the bundled data on demand.

- **Snapshot rarity routing:** Creating or reusing a pricing snapshot now respects your chosen rarity source — if Prohibited Library is active, card rarities are derived from weight data instead of poe.ninja prices.
