- **Custom rarity source dropdown:** The native select element for picking your rarity source (on the Cards and Current Session pages) has been replaced with a polished popover dropdown featuring grouped options, rich labels with hover hints, checkmarks, and outdated-filter warnings.

- **Filter column rarity sorting:** Filter columns on the Rarity Model comparison page now have clickable R1–R4 rarity chips in their headers, letting you sort by a specific tier — just like the poe.ninja and Prohibited Library columns.

- **Boss card toggle:** Boss-exclusive cards are now hidden from the Rarity Model table by default. A new "Include boss cards" checkbox in the toolbar lets you bring them back, at which point a skull-crown indicator column appears so you can identify them at a glance.

- **"Show differences only" always visible:** The diff toggle on the Rarity Model toolbar is now always rendered (disabled when no filters are parsed) instead of appearing and disappearing, making the UI more predictable.
