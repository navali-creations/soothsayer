- **Fixed inactive leagues showing in selector:** Ended leagues (e.g. Phrecia 2.0) no longer appear in the league selector.

- **Fixed rarity filter ignoring rarity source:** The rarity filter and sort on the Cards page now correctly reflect whichever rarity source you've selected, instead of always using poe.ninja values.

- **Fixed card animations when switching rarity source:** All cards now animate consistently when you change the rarity source, instead of some staying static.

- **Boss card toggle on Cards page:** A new "Include boss cards" checkbox lets you show or hide boss-exclusive cards. They are hidden by default, matching the Rarity Model page behavior.

- **Boss-exclusive card indicator:** Cards that only drop from bosses now display a skull-crown badge on the card itself with a tooltip.

- **Rarity-colored card glow:** Cards on the Cards page now glow in their rarity color (white, blue, or cyan) instead of a plain white glow.

- **Scroll to top on filter and page change:** Changing any filter or clicking a pagination button now scrolls the card grid back to the top.
