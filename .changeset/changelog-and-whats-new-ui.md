New features and bug fixes:

- **New title bar menu:** The settings icon in the title bar has been replaced with a dropdown menu. Settings, along with other new items, can now be found there.

- **"What's New" dialog:** You can now see the latest release highlights at a glance — just open the new dropdown menu and click "What's New."

- **Changelog page:** A full release history is now available right inside the app. Open the dropdown menu and click "Changelog" to browse past updates in a clean timeline view.

- **Feedback link:** Quickly jump to our Discord to share feedback — also available in the new dropdown menu.

- **Fixed divination cards not showing up:** Cards were not appearing on the Cards page in packaged builds due to an incorrect file path. They should now load correctly on first launch.
