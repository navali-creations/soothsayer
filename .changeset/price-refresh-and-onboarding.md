- **Refresh poe.ninja prices:** A new "Refresh poe.ninja" button on the Rarity Model page lets you manually fetch the latest card pricing data. After refreshing, the button shows a cooldown timer so you know exactly when the next refresh becomes available. Each league tracks its cooldown independently — switching leagues lets you refresh right away.

- **Onboarding guides:** New interactive help beacons have been added across the app to explain key features. Look for the pulsing icons next to the poe.ninja column, the refresh button, and the scan/filter controls on the Rarity Model page, as well as the rarity source dropdown on the Current Session page.

- **"Show differences only" toggle:** You can now filter the Rarity Model table to show only cards where your filter's rarity assignment differs from poe.ninja, making it easier to spot mismatches at a glance.

- **Improved changelog rendering:** Release notes and changelogs now display with proper formatting — bold text, links, images, and code snippets all render correctly instead of showing raw Markdown.
