Auto-update improvements:

  - **Smoother updates:** Updates now install in the background without intrusive pop-up dialogs. When a new version is ready, a small green icon appears in the title bar so you can update at your convenience.

  - **Linux update notifications:** Linux users will now see a notification icon when a new version is available. Clicking it opens the GitHub Releases page where you can download the latest package.
