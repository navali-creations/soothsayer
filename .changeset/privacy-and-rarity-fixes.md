- **Masked file paths for privacy:** File paths shown in the Storage card and Game Configuration settings are now masked by default, hiding your OS username. Click the eye icon next to any path to reveal the full location when needed.

- **Rarity Model now loads Prohibited Library data automatically:** Previously, the Prohibited Library rarity column on the Rarity Model page would appear empty for new users until they visited the Profit Forecast page or manually reloaded from Settings. The bundled card weight data now loads on demand when you open the Rarity Model page.
