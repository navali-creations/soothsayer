- **Audio settings:** You can now enable/disable drop sounds, adjust volume, and assign custom `.mp3` sounds for each rarity tier directly from Settings.

- **Custom sounds:** Load your own sounds from your PoE filter sounds folder with a single click, preview them, and assign them to rarity tiers.

- **Overlay audio:** The overlay now respects your audio settings — custom sounds play during sessions, with automatic fallback to defaults if a file is missing.

- **Settings UI polish:** Consistent sizing and styling across all settings cards, buttons, and controls.

- **View Source link:** A new "View Source" menu item links directly to the GitHub repository.

- **Open source:** Soothsayer is now fully open source under the AGPL-3.0 license.

- **README refresh:** Updated project description and added a download badge linking to the latest release.
